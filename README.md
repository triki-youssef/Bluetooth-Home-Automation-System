 
<h1> 🔌🏠  Bluetooth Home Automation System</h1>

<h2> 🔸 Description : </h2>

<h3>📲 Control Your Entire Home from Your Smartphone </h3>
This project allows you to remotely control up to 8 electrical devices (like lights, fans, TV, or any home appliance) using your smartphone via Bluetooth. It’s built using an Arduino Uno, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and a 5V 8-channel relay module — and paired with a custom app developed in MIT App Inventor.

Whether you're relaxing on your couch or managing devices from across the room, this system makes your home smarter and more convenient.

<h3>🔑 Key Features : </h3>
- ✅ Bluetooth Control: Remotely turn ON/OFF up to 8 devices using your smartphone via Bluetooth (no internet required).

- 📱 Custom Mobile App: Android app built using MIT App Inventor — clean UI with individual buttons for each appliance.

- ⚡ Control High-Voltage Devices: Each relay channel can handle standard AC appliances like lights, fans, or TVs.

- 💡 Independent Channels: Control devices individually — each relay works separately for flexibility.

- 🔒 Secure Connection: Only paired devices can send commands, ensuring basic security.

- 🔌 Plug & Play: Easy-to-understand wiring and simple setup using Arduino Uno.

- 🔋 Low Power: Operates on a 5V relay system, ideal for low-power automation.

- 🛠️ Expandable: Can be upgraded to include sensors, Wi-Fi, or voice control in the future.
